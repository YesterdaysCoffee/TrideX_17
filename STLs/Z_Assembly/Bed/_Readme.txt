Types of Bed Carriage and Bed Frame:

Type Differences explained: Each type changes the height of build surface from the carriage.  

Before the bed is leveled with Z_Tilt_Adjust extra space is needed to prevent the Carriage's from hitting the Idlers. Type C has the least out-of-level play. To prevent carriage/idler collisions level the bed by eye before using Z_Tilt_Adjust.

The height of the bed surface affects your print-volume height. Type A has the lowest bed and Type C has the highest.

Type A:  Lowest bed surface. Drops the bed surface down the furthest. Use with the very long hot-ends.

Type B:  Lifts the bed surface to an "average" height.  

Type C:  Highest bed surface.  Use for very short hot-ends or when extra print-volume height is needed.  Note: used with normal hot-ends, such as Rapido 2 HF, will give about 5mm out-of-level play.
