# TrideX_17
Two headed IDEX verson of Trident: uses a variety of pieces/parts from the VORON commuity.

If you found this, congratulations and I'm sorry for your disappointment.  This is very much a "In Developement" project right now, some parts are in design beta and none have been tested.

Major features/contributions:
Voron Trident,
Belted-Z, z-motor mounts from Voron 2.4 (v2.4)
XY drives are NEMA 17 motors:  This IDEX uses a modified cartesion motion system instead of coreXY.  Hence, the AB drives are called XY drives.
Dragon Burner tool heads
Skirts are a mixup of Trident and v2.4
Custom skirts expanding on the standardv2.4

Sizing  will maintain the standards set by v2.4 of 250, 300 & 350mm sizing EXCEPT for the build plate.  With two toolheads, the idol one needs to park out of the way of the active one.

Spelling errors will be addressed later.
