# TrideX_17
Two headed verson of Trident.

This is an updated version of TrideX by [eddietheengineer](https://github.com/FrankenVoron/Tridex).

##Features and Improvements:
```
NEMA 17 steppers for X and Y
Belted Z using standard NEMA 17 motors.
Improved belt path and belt assembly
```
##Skirts & Corners: 
```
Optional power switch on sides
USB port in front skirts
LED power switch and dimmer on front skirts, independent from main power switch
```
Electronics bay accessible from the chamber (no more flipping upside down)

#Sizing considerations:
A good starting poing is a 250mm X 250mm build plate with frame size of 350mm width X 250mm depth.
The extra 100mm width and narrow tool heads like the Dragon Burner gives the idle tool head space to park out-of-the-way.
Frame Size uses standards from Voron Trident: 250, 300 & 350mm with the addition of 400mm for X axis and 200mm on Y axis.  Note, the rear gantry support extrusion is shorter than standard.
Warning: 200mm depth will make fitting electronics a challange (it didn't work for me).

##Notes:
Using a square build plate will be easiest to source.
