# TrideX_17
Two headed verson of Trident, aka IDEX Trident.  This is not intended for novice users, kits and tutorials are not available.  Documentation will be minimal.  Oh, in case you still are thinking about building this, 

This is an updated version of TrideX by [eddietheengineer](https://github.com/FrankenVoron/Tridex).

# Version 0.5
This version is ready for advanced users to start the build process.  I'm comfortable each piece good to go and expect some more modifications and tweeks in the near future.  The last major addition will be the bottom deck supports and z-motor guards.
Yet to be included:
see to do list below.

# Features and Improvements:
```
NEMA 17 steppers for X and Y
Belted Z using standard NEMA 17 motors.
Improved belt path and belt assembly
```
# Skirts & Corners: 
```
Optional power switch on sides
USB port in front skirts
LED power switch and dimmer on front skirts, independent from main power switch
```
Electronics bay accessible from the chamber (no more flipping upside down)

# Sizing considerations:
A good starting poing is a 250mm X 250mm build plate with frame size of 350mm width X 250mm depth.
The extra 100mm width and narrow tool heads like the Dragon Burner gives the idle tool head space to park out-of-the-way.
Frame Size uses standards from Voron Trident: 250, 300 & 350mm with the addition of 400mm for X axis and 200mm on Y axis.  Note, the rear gantry support extrusion is shorter than standard.
Warning: 200mm depth will make fitting electronics a challange (it didn't work for me).

# Notes:
Using a square build plate will be easiest to source.

# To do:
```
Add skirts, corners, feet, folding deck to CAD
Add BOM
Include description of certain parts, such heat insert size to BOM
Add photos, well duh.
include link to current "active" IDEX macro developer(s).
Ponder improvement of belt threading for XY drives.
Add assembly tips and tricks
```

# Got Comments, suggestions, gripes, pizza, praise, flames, offers to help?
Mac McCaskie --> <NameNoSpaces> yahoo com (you know where to put the punctuation)

Mostly I need someone else to assemble this and critique the process.
